# Hi, I'm Jieyu Zhou

I'm an undergraduate student at **Nanjing University**, majoring in **Mathematics and Applied Mathematics**, and applying for PhD programs in Fall 2026. I enjoy exploring problems in **statistical network analysis** and **generative models**.

## Research Interests
- **Generative modeling from a mathematical perspective** — understanding and formulating generative models (such as diffusion and consistency models) through rigorous mathematical ideas.  
- **Machine learning for statistical problems** — applying modern machine learning tools to address challenges in statistical methodology and applications.  

## Current & Past Research

- **University of Michigan** (Visiting student, Summer 2025)  
  Working on *statistical network analysis*, specifically a project using **variational autoencoders (VAEs)** for link prediction, under the supervision of [Prof. Ji Zhu](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/).  

- **Westlake University – [LINS Lab](https://lins-lab.github.io/)** (Visiting student, Summer 2024 & Winter 2025)  
  Research intern supervised by [Prof. Tao Lin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/tao-lin.html).  
  I engaged in exploratory work on:
  - Developing improved samplers for diffusion models  
  - Mitigating repetitions in auto-regressive models using fixed-point theory  
  - Exploring diffusion and consistency models from a unified perspective  
  Grateful for the guidance of [Peng Sun](https://sp12138.github.io/) (PhD student) during this period.

- 🎵 I appreciate **Cantonese songs** — [see my top album on Spotify (last 6 months)](images/cantonese-songs/spotify-past-6-months-album.JPG)  

- 🌍 I am a **language enthusiast** — currently learning **Spanish** and have passed the **DELE A1** test 🇪🇸
